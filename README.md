Note: This program is HARMLESS to your files. It does not infect your computer. When ran, the program will be a non-interactive UI, that is intended to look like SpySheriff. This program will begin to duplicate itself until the computer is rebooted. Once your computer is rebooted, the program will not run unless opened by the user again.
No files are damaged or deleted when running this software. However, it is still advised you save and close all other applications you may have open prior to running this program.

Program was written in C#, source code will not be public, but this program is very easy to replicate even without extensive knowledge of the C# language.

I am not to be held responsible for any damage to your system, this program is intended as a JOKE and not made with any real malicious intentions.
